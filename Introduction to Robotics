ROBOTICS: - a branch of engineering that involves the conception, design, manufacture and operation of robots. The objective of the robotics field is to create intelligent machines that can assist humans in a variety of ways.

Laws of Robotics
Law 1:  A robot may not injure a human being or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
Law 2: A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law

A MICROPROCESSOR: - is a computer processor where the data processing logic and control is included on a single integrated circuit (IC), or a small number of ICs. The microprocessor contains the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry required to perform the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU).

MICROCONTROLLER: - A microcontroller is a small computer on a single VLSI integrated circuit (IC) chip. A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.
